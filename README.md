Overview:

The Java Phonebook Management System (JPMS) is a web-based application developed using Java Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and MySQL database. It provides users with a platform to manage their contacts efficiently through a user-friendly web interface.

Key Features:

 User Authentication: Secure registration and login functionality ensure authorized access to the system.
Contact Management: Users can effortlessly add, view, edit, and delete contacts, including details like name, phone number, email, and notes.
Search Functionality: Intuitive search options enable quick retrieval of contacts by various attributes.
Sorting and Filtering: Contacts can be sorted and filtered based on multiple criteria for better organization.
Grouping Contacts: Contacts can be categorized into groups or lists to enhance management efficiency.
User Interface: A user-friendly interface developed with JSP ensures seamless navigation and interaction.
Data Validation: Input validation mechanisms guarantee data accuracy and prevent errors.
Security: Robust security measures protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
Data Persistence: Contact information is securely stored in a MySQL database, ensuring data integrity.
Error Handling: Effective error handling mechanisms provide informative feedback to users in case of exceptions.

Technology Stack:

•Java Servlets and JSP: For server-side logic and dynamic web page generation.
